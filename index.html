        <h2><em>Our Theories:</em></h2>
        <ol><li>Episode #1 theory:<br><p class="indent"> What if Bily Cranson ( David Yost) creates the cosmic fury morphers? The last time we see Billy unmorphed was in Zeo leaving for Aquatar.
        Aquatar has more advanced techonlogy and since Billy can't morph himself, it woud be weird if he wasn't working on something ranger related.
         So we know the cosmic fury rangers are headig off into space, but at the end of dino fury they don't recive any new powers.
        This leaves the rangers at somewhat of a disadavge because, they don't know what they are up against, and Zayto is the only one with new powers.
        The dino fury ranges head into space, but where will they go?<br></p><p class="indent">
         Solon would probaly suggest Aquatar because they might know where to start.
         The aquatarians would probally know about Zedd and all his activies in space.
        They would  warn the rangers that they need some help to defet Zedd, but the rangers were already gone.
        The dino fury rangers for the third time face Zedd with his staff.
        Every other time they had fought with Zedd, the Morphin Masters were there to infere.
        This time, they were on there own. For about 5 seconds.
        The aquatarian rangers knew the dino rangers were in troube from the start.
        So, for the first time since the legendary battle, the entire team leaps into the fray. 
        Meanwhile on Aquatar, we see Billy tikering with many objects that he fits togeher, making the cosmic fury morphers?
        The new crisis now? Getting them to the rangers.<br></p><p class="indent">
        On the verge of defeat all the rangers are getting desperate.
        Zedd was about to end them once and for all when..... flooooossshh, the dino rangers get teloported.
        Frusterated, Zedd returns to his new headquaters, where he meets up with Scrozzle, and the two evil rangers, Lord Drakkon and Spa'ark. 
        The rangers try to figure out where they are. It doesn't look like a planet because it's man-made.            
        They coclude it's a spaceship, but they wonder who does it belong to?
        Their anwser comes when a figure in a blue and white cloak emereges into the bridge replied that they coudn't fight and win against Zedd alone, the aquatarian rangers had already paid for their rashness, this would be the Cosmic Fury headquaters if they choose to except their new mission.</p></li></ol>
